    "# Multi Agents: Clinical Metadata Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project provides a powerful system for extracting and structuring clinical metadata from a given set of text chunks, such as those found in medical case studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is composed of two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. RetrieverAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetrieverAgent` is responsible for iteratively querying a vector database to retrieve the relevant text chunks for a given metadata category. It takes the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A language model (LLM) for generating the queries\n",
    "- A `RetrieverManager`: contain tools for querying the vector database and ranking the retrieved chunks\n",
    "- A `ChunkManager`: contain tools for managing the storage of retrieved text chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RetrieverAgent` follows an iterative process to extract the relevant text chunks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The agent uses initial query and the `RetrieverManager` to retrieve and rank the relevant chunks.\n",
    "2. The agent then analyze if retrieved chunks are relevant and then stores them using the `ChunkManager` for later use by the `MetadataExtractionAgent`.\n",
    "3. If retrieved chunks are not relevant then the agent refine the initial query and retrieve the chunks again.\n",
    "4. The process continues until the agent is confident that it has extracted all relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. MetadataExtractionAgent\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MetadataExtractionAgent` is responsible for the overall process of extracting and structuring the clinical metadata. It takes the following inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A language model (LLM) for generating the metadata\n",
    "- A `ChunkManager`: contain tools for managing the storage of retrieved text chunks\n",
    "- A `MetadataManager`: contain tools for managing the stored sentence snippets from each chunks\n",
    "- An `OutputValidator`: Tool for validating the final structured metadata output\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MetadataExtractionAgent` follows a multi-step process to produce the final metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It generates a detailed prompt that instructs the LLM to analyze the text chunks and extract relevant information for the specified metadata categories.\n",
    "2. The agent analyze each chunks and extract sentence snippets which are relevant for a speicific metadata categories. \n",
    "3. It uses `MetadataManager` tool for maintain all extracted sentence snippets and later generates the final structured output.\n",
    "3. The agent validates the generated output using the `OutputValidator` tool, and if errors or missing fields are detected, the agent will retry the process until the valid output is generated.\n",
    "4. The final, validated metadata is returned as a structured dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the System Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete system works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `RetrieverAgent` is used to extract relevant text chunks for a subset of the metadata categories.\n",
    "2. The `MetadataExtractionAgent` is then used to generate the final structured metadata, leveraging the text chunks retrieved by the `RetrieverAgent`.\n",
    "3. The `OutputValidator` is used to ensure the generated metadata conforms to the expected data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two-step approach, with the `RetrieverAgent` handling the chunk extraction and the `MetadataExtractionAgent` handling the final metadata generation, allows the system to efficiently and accurately extract clinical metadata from the given text data.\n"

Considering that this patient with UC and CARC was elderly, laparoscopic total proctocolectomy combined with abdominoperineal resec-tion and ileostomy was performed to avoid the risk of residual cancer and fecal incontinence. The resulting resected specimen showed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with a component of mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2a, b), and dysplastic epithelium was observed in the area surrounding the cancer lesion. Fur-thermore, abnormal p53 accumulation was found by immunohistochemical examination (Fig. 2ce), which was compatible with CARC. The cancer invaded the muscularlayer without node metastasis, and therefore was eventually diagnosed as pT2 and pN0, Stage I according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 7th edition [ 6]. At the same time of admission for surgery for CARC, the patients laboratory data revealed elevated c-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels of 133and 371 IU/L, respectively. The aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were normal, and the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was 32.3 U/mL.Abdominal enhanced CT revealed partial intrahepatic bileduct dilation in the left lateral section of the liver (Fig. 3a), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated stenosis and dilation of the bile duct in the left lateral sector (Fig. 3b). At the same time, cholangiography demonstrated a pruned-tree appearance in the bile duct of the right lobe which led to a suspicious diagnosis of primary sclerotic cholangitis. However, brush cytology of the stenotic siterevealed no malignancy. At 6 months after the total proctocolectomy, the patients laboratory data revealed elevation of his CA19-9 level to 56.4 U/mL. Although a malignant tumor of the bile duct could still not be observed, the possibility of ICC at the stenosis in thehepatic duct was suspected because biliary stenosis with atrophy of the left lateral section had not changed. Therefore, we decided to perform a left hepatectomy and toattempt intraoperative pathological diagnosis in the cut edge of the bile duct to determine whether to add extrahepatic bile duct resection. After the left hepatectomy, an intraoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in the liver was made, and abnormal cells were observed in the left bile duct at the rst resectedsite. An additional resected specimen of the left bile duct and caudate branch revealed no malignant tumor. The resected specimen showed a bile duct carcinoma of 2 cm indiameter and stenosis of the hepatic duct wall, which represented an ICC of the periductal inltration invading the left branch of the portal vein (Fig. 4a). The primary well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma inltrating the liver parenchyma was diagnosed histologically (Fig. 4b). In addition, an onion-skin appearance indicating PSC wasfound in the non-cancerous region of the liver (Fig. 4c). Finally, the periductal inltration type was classied as T4, and was diagnosed as pT4 and pN0, Stage IVa according tothe UICC classication 7th edition [ 6]. Fig. \n",

Considering that this patient with UC and CARC was elderly, laparoscopic total proctocolectomy combined with abdominoperineal resec-tion and ileostomy was performed to avoid the risk of residual cancer and fecal incontinence. The resulting resected specimen showed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with a component of mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2a, b), and dysplastic epithelium was observed in the area surrounding the cancer lesion. Fur-thermore, abnormal p53 accumulation was found by immunohistochemical examination (Fig. 2ce), which was compatible with CARC. The cancer invaded the muscularlayer without node metastasis, and therefore was eventually diagnosed as pT2 and pN0, Stage I according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 7th edition [ 6]. At the same time of admission for surgery for CARC, the patients laboratory data revealed elevated c-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels of 133and 371 IU/L, respectively.

At the same time, cholangiography demonstrated a pruned-tree appearance in the bile duct of the right lobe which led to a suspicious diagnosis of primary sclerotic cholangitis. However, brush cytology of the stenotic siterevealed no malignancy. At 6 months after the total proctocolectomy, the patients laboratory data revealed elevation of his CA19-9 level to 56.4 U/mL. Although a malignant tumor of the bile duct could still not be observed, the possibility of ICC at the stenosis in thehepatic duct was suspected because biliary stenosis with atrophy of the left lateral section had not changed. Therefore, we decided to perform a left hepatectomy and toattempt intraoperative pathological diagnosis in the cut edge of the bile duct to determine whether to add extrahepatic bile duct resection. After the left hepatectomy, an intraoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in the liver was made, and abnormal cells were observed in the left bile duct at the rst resectedsite. An additional resected specimen of the left bile duct and caudate branch revealed no malignant tumor. The resected specimen showed a bile duct carcinoma of 2 cm indiameter and stenosis of the hepatic duct wall, which represented an ICC of the periductal inltration invading the left branch of the portal vein (Fig. 4a).

Keywords Colitic cancer /C1Cholangiocarcinoma /C1UC /C1 PSC Introduction Colitic cancer is appreciated as a colitis-associated colorectal cancer that develops in long-standing and extensive ulcerative colitis (UC). The number of patients with colitic cancer has increased recently along with increased morbidity from UC in Japan [ 1]. The risk factors for colitic cancer are considered to be long disease duration, extensive lesions, family history of colon cancer, and additionally, the complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [2,3]. Patients with PSC are also at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma [ 4], which is known as a disease with poor prognosis in terms of the difculty in making an imaging diagnosis and the involvement of lymph nodes [ 4,5]. We report a patient with concomitant UC and PSC who developed colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which we successfully cured by surgery. This is a rare case of CARC and ICC complicating these diseases in Japan. Case report A 73-year-old man with a 19-year history of UC was referred to our hospital.

Keywords Colitic cancer /C1Cholangiocarcinoma /C1UC /C1 PSC Introduction Colitic cancer is appreciated as a colitis-associated colorectal cancer that develops in long-standing and extensive ulcerative colitis (UC). The number of patients with colitic cancer has increased recently along with increased morbidity from UC in Japan [ 1]. The risk factors for colitic cancer are considered to be long disease duration, extensive lesions, family history of colon cancer, and additionally, the complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [2,3]. Patients with PSC are also at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma [ 4], which is known as a disease with poor prognosis in terms of the difculty in making an imaging diagnosis and the involvement of lymph nodes [ 4,5]. We report a patient with concomitant UC and PSC who developed colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which we successfully cured by surgery. This is a rare case of CARC and ICC complicating these diseases in Japan. Case report A 73-year-old man with a 19-year history of UC was referred to our hospital. He had undergone colonoscopy every year at a previous outpatient clinic.

Considering that this patient with UC and CARC was elderly, laparoscopic total proctocolectomy combined with abdominoperineal resec-tion and ileostomy was performed to avoid the risk of residual cancer and fecal incontinence. The resulting resected specimen showed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with a component of mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2a, b), and dysplastic epithelium was observed in the area surrounding the cancer lesion. Fur-thermore, abnormal p53 accumulation was found by immunohistochemical examination (Fig. 2ce), which was compatible with CARC. The cancer invaded the muscularlayer without node metastasis, and therefore was eventually diagnosed as pT2 and pN0, Stage I according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 7th edition [ 6]. At the same time of admission for surgery for CARC, the patients laboratory data revealed elevated c-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels of 133and 371 IU/L, respectively. The aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were normal, and the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was 32.3 U/mL.Abdominal enhanced CT revealed partial intrahepatic bileduct dilation in the left lateral section of the liver (Fig. 3a), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated stenosis and dilation of the bile duct in the left lateral sector (Fig. 3b). At the same time, cholangiography demonstrated a pruned-tree appearance in the bile duct of the right lobe which led to a suspicious diagnosis of primary sclerotic cholangitis. However, brush cytology of the stenotic siterevealed no malignancy. At 6 months after the total proctocolectomy, the patients laboratory data revealed elevation of his CA19-9 level to 56.4 U/mL. Although a malignant tumor of the bile duct could still not be observed, the possibility of ICC at the stenosis in thehepatic duct was suspected because biliary stenosis with atrophy of the left lateral section had not changed. Therefore, we decided to perform a left hepatectomy and toattempt intraoperative pathological diagnosis in the cut edge of the bile duct to determine whether to add extrahepatic bile duct resection. After the left hepatectomy, an intraoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in the liver was made, and abnormal cells were observed in the left bile duct at the rst resectedsite. An additional resected specimen of the left bile duct and caudate branch revealed no malignant tumor. The resected specimen showed a bile duct carcinoma of 2 cm indiameter and stenosis of the hepatic duct wall, which represented an ICC of the periductal inltration invading the left branch of the portal vein (Fig. 4a). The primary well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma inltrating the liver parenchyma was diagnosed histologically (Fig. 4b). In addition, an onion-skin appearance indicating PSC wasfound in the non-cancerous region of the liver (Fig. 4c). Finally, the periductal inltration type was classied as T4, and was diagnosed as pT4 and pN0, Stage IVa according tothe UICC classication 7th edition [ 6]. Fig.\n",

The patient remains alive and has been followed-up for 2.5 years after hepatectomy with no recurrence of ICC orcolitic cancer observed. Discussion In this report, we presented a case of CARC and ICC thatdeveloped after a 19-year follow-up of UC associated with PSC. A search of the Japanese literature found only oneprevious case report of CARC and ICC complicating UC, indicating the rarity of the present case [ 7]. A PubMed search revealed no other reports like our case diagnosed denitely as CARC-complicated cholangiocarcinoma inUC and PSC. Colitic cancer was rst reported by Crohn and Rosenberg in 1925 as colitis-associated cancer [ 8]. Following this, Morson and Pang reported that surveillance for dysplasia would lead to the identication of colitic cancer [ 9]. In recent years, colonoscopic surveillance for long-stand-ing UC patients is generally accepted to avoid unnecessary prophylactic colectomy and to reduce mortality due to colitic cancer [ 10]. As the prognosis of Stage III colitic cancer is worse than that of sporadic cancer in Japan [ 11], the early detection of cancer by careful surveillance is Fig.\n",

Furthermore, UC is known to complicate primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which subsequently results in an increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. We report a case of colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC) accompanied by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) based on UC and PSC. A 73-year-old man had suffered from UC for 19 years. During surveillance colonoscopy, a tumor was found in the rectum that was pathologically diagnosed as CARC from the resected specimen. Abdominal computed tomography also revealed a localized dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a bandlike stricture. This remarkable tumor lesion was not observed in the hepatic duct. Left hepatectomy was performed because of the suspicion of possible ICC at the stenosis of the hepatic duct. The presence of ICC was conrmed at the lesion causing the stricture.\n",

Keywords Colitic cancer /C1Cholangiocarcinoma /C1UC /C1 PSC Introduction Colitic cancer is appreciated as a colitis-associated colorectal cancer that develops in long-standing and extensive ulcerative colitis (UC). The number of patients with colitic cancer has increased recently along with increased morbidity from UC in Japan [ 1]. The risk factors for colitic cancer are considered to be long disease duration, extensive lesions, family history of colon cancer, and additionally, the complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [2,3]. Patients with PSC are also at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma [ 4], which is known as a disease with poor prognosis in terms of the difculty in making an imaging diagnosis and the involvement of lymph nodes [ 4,5]. We report a patient with concomitant UC and PSC who developed colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which we successfully cured by surgery. This is a rare case of CARC and ICC complicating these diseases in Japan. Case report A 73-year-old man with a 19-year history of UC was referred to our hospital. He had undergone colonoscopy every year at a previous outpatient clinic.
