The European guidelines recommend surveillance involving highquality visual inspection of the mucosa, using chromoen-doscopy and target biopsy with endoscopic recognition of colorectal dysplasia in patients with inammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ 12]. In our case, chromoendoscopic examination revealed an elevated lesion surrounded by erosion with unclear margins, indicating a dysplasia-associated lesion or mass for which we performed surgery. Eventually, the surgically resected specimen showed invasive adenocarcinoma with the coexistence of dysplasia asindicated by p53 staining. In colitic cancer, p53 immunoreactivity is useful to conne the basal half of the glands associated with early neoplastic lesions [ 13].

Considering that this patient with UC and CARC was elderly, laparoscopic total proctocolectomy combined with abdominoperineal resec-tion and ileostomy was performed to avoid the risk of residual cancer and fecal incontinence. The resulting resected specimen showed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma with a component of mucinous adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2a, b), and dysplastic epithelium was observed in the area surrounding the cancer lesion. Fur-thermore, abnormal p53 accumulation was found by immunohistochemical examination (Fig. 2ce), which was compatible with CARC. The cancer invaded the muscularlayer without node metastasis, and therefore was eventually diagnosed as pT2 and pN0, Stage I according to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 7th edition [ 6]. At the same time of admission for surgery for CARC, the patients laboratory data revealed elevated c-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels of 133and 371 IU/L, respectively. The aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were normal, and the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level was 32.3 U/mL.Abdominal enhanced CT revealed partial intrahepatic bileduct dilation in the left lateral section of the liver (Fig. 3a), and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography demonstrated stenosis and dilation of the bile duct in the left lateral sector (Fig. 3b). At the same time, cholangiography demonstrated a pruned-tree appearance in the bile duct of the right lobe which led to a suspicious diagnosis of primary sclerotic cholangitis. However, brush cytology of the stenotic siterevealed no malignancy. At 6 months after the total proctocolectomy, the patients laboratory data revealed elevation of his CA19-9 level to 56.4 U/mL. Although a malignant tumor of the bile duct could still not be observed, the possibility of ICC at the stenosis in thehepatic duct was suspected because biliary stenosis with atrophy of the left lateral section had not changed. Therefore, we decided to perform a left hepatectomy and toattempt intraoperative pathological diagnosis in the cut edge of the bile duct to determine whether to add extrahepatic bile duct resection. After the left hepatectomy, an intraoperative diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in the liver was made, and abnormal cells were observed in the left bile duct at the rst resectedsite. An additional resected specimen of the left bile duct and caudate branch revealed no malignant tumor. The resected specimen showed a bile duct carcinoma of 2 cm indiameter and stenosis of the hepatic duct wall, which represented an ICC of the periductal inltration invading the left branch of the portal vein (Fig. 4a). The primary well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma inltrating the liver parenchyma was diagnosed histologically (Fig. 4b). In addition, an onion-skin appearance indicating PSC wasfound in the non-cancerous region of the liver (Fig. 4c). Finally, the periductal inltration type was classied as T4, and was diagnosed as pT4 and pN0, Stage IVa according tothe UICC classication 7th edition [ 6].

The patient remains alive and has been followed-up for 2.5 years after hepatectomy with no recurrence of ICC orcolitic cancer observed. Discussion In this report, we presented a case of CARC and ICC thatdeveloped after a 19-year follow-up of UC associated with PSC. A search of the Japanese literature found only oneprevious case report of CARC and ICC complicating UC, indicating the rarity of the present case [ 7]. A PubMed search revealed no other reports like our case diagnosed denitely as CARC-complicated cholangiocarcinoma inUC and PSC. Colitic cancer was rst reported by Crohn and Rosenberg in 1925 as colitis-associated cancer [ 8]. Following this, Morson and Pang reported that surveillance for dysplasia would lead to the identication of colitic cancer [ 9]. In recent years, colonoscopic surveillance for long-stand-ing UC patients is generally accepted to avoid unnecessary prophylactic colectomy and to reduce mortality due to colitic cancer [ 10]. As the prognosis of Stage III colitic cancer is worse than that of sporadic cancer in Japan [ 11], the early detection of cancer by careful surveillance is Fig.", "c89d11e5-88a3-44bc-9745-60e09d37adc9": "CASE REPORT A case of concomitant colitic cancer and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma during follow-up for ulcerative colitis Kazuyo Tsuchiya1Atsushi Nanashima2Takuto Ikeda1Shiro Minami3 Motoaki Nagano4Takeomi Hamada2Koichi Yano2Yoshiro Fujii2 Received: 8 November 2016 / Accepted: 17 January 2017 / Published online: 30 January 2017 /C211Japanese Society of Gastroenterology 2017 Abstract Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is known to occur in long-standing and extensive ulcerative colitis (UC). Furthermore, UC is known to complicate primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which subsequently results in an increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. We report a case of colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC) accompanied by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) based on UC and PSC. A 73-year-old man had suffered from UC for 19 years. During surveillance colonoscopy, a tumor was found in the rectum that was pathologically diagnosed as CARC from the resected specimen. Abdominal computed tomography also revealed a localized dilation of the intrahepatic bile duct, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a bandlike stricture. This remarkable tumor lesion was not observed in the hepatic duct. Left hepatectomy was performed because of the suspicion of possible ICC at the stenosis of the hepatic duct. The presence of ICC was conrmed at the lesion causing the stricture.", "493cb455-3d34-4d6d-8c47-a5c6323a281f": "The pathological diagnosis from the resected specimen was ICC based on PSC.

Keywords Colitic cancer /C1Cholangiocarcinoma /C1UC /C1 PSC Introduction Colitic cancer is appreciated as a colitis-associated colorectal cancer that develops in long-standing and extensive ulcerative colitis (UC). The number of patients with colitic cancer has increased recently along with increased morbidity from UC in Japan [ 1]. The risk factors for colitic cancer are considered to be long disease duration, extensive lesions, family history of colon cancer, and additionally, the complication of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) [2,3]. Patients with PSC are also at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma [ 4], which is known as a disease with poor prognosis in terms of the difculty in making an imaging diagnosis and the involvement of lymph nodes [ 4,5]. We report a patient with concomitant UC and PSC who developed colitis-associated rectal cancer (CARC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), which we successfully cured by surgery. This is a rare case of CARC and ICC complicating these diseases in Japan. Case report A 73-year-old man with a 19-year history of UC was referred to our hospital. He had undergone colonoscopy every year at a previous outpatient clinic.
